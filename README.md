## Contribute blacklists

Edit the source files in `src/` and issue a pull request.


## Build blacklists

Run `scripts/build.py -h` for usage help.

Run `scripts/build.py auto` for most common tasks: aggregate sources, tidy source files, and build blacklists.

Run `scripts/build.py auto lint` to tidy source files.

Run `scripts/build.py auto uniquify` to deduplicate source files (may take a long time).


## License

The blacklists are mostly released under MIT license, but you may have to check the underlying license of the sources for aggregated contents.
