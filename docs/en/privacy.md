Privacy Policy
==============

Content Farm Terminator does not collect personal information from the user.

Content Farm Terminator makes a web request only when updating web blacklists, whose URLs are specified by the user. Related connections do not include personal information; however the web master may get the IP address from the user or may create a site-specific Cookie to track the user. How these information will be used depends on the privacy policy of the connected web site, and the user should confirm that by themselves.

The default web blacklist is hosted on GitHub, which is affiliated to GitHub Corporation (a subsidiary of Microsoft). The user can remove the default web blacklist on demand.

### Usage of the request permissions

* **webRequest**, **webRequestBlocking**: To analyse web requests and block connections to a content farm.
* **tabs**: To access tabs to mark content farm links which may be generated dynamically.
* **Access any web page (`http://*`, `https://*`)**: To access the content of any web page to identify hyperlinks to a content farm.
* **storage**: To store configs or to cache parsed configs.
* **unlimitedStorage**: Allow unlimited size of customized blocklists.
* **contextMenus**: To show a context menu for certain shortcut features.
