hosts file blacklists
=====================

Usage: Copy the content of a blacklist into the [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) (administrator privileges required).
- Path in Windows: `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
- Path in a Unix-like OS: `/etc/hosts`.

A [hosts tool](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) can also be used to help build a robust hosts file from a variety of frequently updated sources.

As a hosts file can only block a domain (and subdomain), these blacklists do not include other type of rules.

See [main subscription page](./subscriptions) for details of the blacklists.
